  <h1>Hiya!</h1>
  <p>
  I was born in the beautiful coastal city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a> and my family moved to another gorgeous coastal city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_British_Columbia">Richmond</a> when I was 8.
  I spent a lot time skateboarding, snowboarding, playing soccer and hockey. I was a huge Canucks fan - they peaked when they lost the cup in game 7 to the Bruins in 2011. <br>
  In the same year, I attended a sixth form college <a href="http://www.scie.com.cn/">SCIE</a> back in Shenzhen. (The Canucks gradually declined since and they didn't even qualify for playoffs in the last few years...) <br>
  Luckily, I moved to Nashville to attend Vandy in 2015 and the predators have been on the rise. Last summer they lost to the Penguins in the finals. I started climbing in college so it's not like I was very invested in NHL.

  <h3> Brief bio </h3>
  <p>
		Reader discretion: there may contain unsolicited information below.
  </p>
  <p>
  I was born in the beautiful coastal city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a> and my family moved to another gorgeous coastal city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_British_Columbia">Richmond</a> when I was 8.<br>
  Growing up, I had lots of time to enjoy skateboarding, snowboarding, playing soccer and hockey. I was a huge Canucks fan... until they lost the cup in game 7 to the Bruins in 2011 (perhaps that shows I'm not true fan).
  </p>
  <p>
  Then in 2011, I attended a sixth form college <a href="http://www.scie.com.cn/">SCIE</a> back in Shenzhen. (Not correlated to the Canucks' downfall) <br>
 		At SCIE, I went through an UK curriculum of reading GCSE and A-Levels in physics, mathematics, biology, geography.<br>
		I continued to play soccer and captained the team. Near the end of sixth form, I picked up downhill skateboarding - a board sport I had not yet tried. It is quite a thrill and eventually I got good enough to be sponsored by a small local surf board company that also made longboards (Shenzhen Longboards but they stopped making longboards). I got to shoot some videos and go to races.

  	<h1>Hello my homies</h1>
  	<p>
		I'm XJ, a senior majoring in physics at Vanderbilt. Currently enjoying the summer and climbing. I made this personal webpage to keep a copy of my self-introduction (you know I sometimes forget who and where I am...) and other little things I've garnered. Feel free to poke around and extract anything of worth to you, if there is any at all.
	</p>
	<p>This site is undergoing heavy blasting and construction...
  		&emsp;Bang bang bangity bang! If something doesn't work, it's probably trying to figure itself out.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		As you've probably already noticed, I am no expert in web design.<br> Yet, I hope the web page serves its purpose of sharing some things <br>
		about myself and what I've learned in physics.
	</p>

	Welcome to this little cozy cyber abode of mine! Please feel at home and poke around if you wish. <br>
		The navigation panel on the left hold the doors to an assorted collection of rooms, containing <br>
		assorted collections of toys for display and sharing.

  <p>a xj particle is observed to occupy a few different states,
  some being more degenerate than others.</p>
  <p>The eigenstates of xj in a confined spherical potential is 
  presented to you on this page.</p>

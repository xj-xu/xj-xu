  <h3> Brief bio </h3>
  <p>
  I was born in the young and modern coastal city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a> and my family moved to another coastal city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_British_Columbia">Richmond</a>, BC when I was 8.<br>
  Growing up, I had lots of time to enjoy skateboarding, snowboarding, playing soccer and hockey. I was a huge Canucks fan... until they lost the cup in game 7 to the Bruins in 2011 (perhaps that shows I'm not a true fan).
  </p>
  <p>
  Then in 2011, I attended a sixth form college <a href="http://www.scie.com.cn/">SCIE</a> back in Shenzhen.<br>
  At SCIE, I went through an UK curriculum of reading GCSE and A-Levels in physics, mathematics, biology, geography.<br>
  I continued to play soccer and captained the team. Near the end of sixth form, I picked up downhill skateboarding - a board sport I had not yet tried. It is quite a thrill and eventually I got good enough to be sponsored by a small local surf board company that also made longboards (Shenzhen Longboard). It was a blast shooting some videos and racing.<br>

	<p>
	In 2015, I moved to Nashville to attend Vandy and started climbing in my sophomore year. I got quite obsessed and it's now pretty much all I do outside of physics during my waking hours. I started a climbing club in my junior year at Vandy and in my senior year, we have started a climbing team competing in the USA Climbing Collegiate Series - super exciting progress!

	Here are some cool pictures of Shenzhen and Richmond.
